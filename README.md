# Zach's README Section
Hello, Harmeet and Maddie and other folks on the Cylera team! This is my submission project for the Senior Frontend Engineer position.

The top section of this README file will be dedicated to project running instructions, initial questions I had, initial assumptions I made development, and a development log (which also contains questions and assumptions). This will help all of us as we move through the interview process.

## How to Run This Project
1.

## Initial Questions and Assumptions
Here are my initial questions and assumptions I came up with while reading this document and looking at the mockups:

- ‚ùì There are no project requirements here pertaining to browser compatibility. On which browsers does this application need to run without bugs?
    - Assumption: It's OK for me to _just pick a browser_ and make sure it works there, as long as I make a note of which browser I'm using.
        - For this project, I'm using **Google Chrome v97.0.4692.99 on Windows 11**. I will make little to no effort to validate that this Dashboard works on other browsers.
- ‚ùì There are no project requirements here pertaining to user accessibility.
    - Assumption: Don't think too hard about accessibility.
        - Note: üòû
- ‚ùì Why does the project scaffolding include a link to an "About" page when this application is explicitly a one-page app?
    - I'm going to remove `about.tsx` from the project entirely.
- ‚ùì Why does the Figma design for this application include a "Logout" button? What is that button supposed to actually do?
    - In my implmentation, I'm going to remove the "Logout" button entirely from the UI, since it doesn't serve any known purpose.
- ‚ùì Neither the spec below nor the mockup discuss app failure states.
    - Assumption: I'm going to focus mainly on the "golden path" and not spend much time on app failure states.
- ‚ùì Should this application show data about past launches, or should it include data about future launches as well?
    - Assumption: This application will only show data about past launches.
- ‚ùì Regarding the "summary statistic cards" at the top of the page:
    - Are the values displayed relative to _all_ missions? Launches? All _successful_ missions? How are these numbers calculated?
        - In reading the "Components & Features" section below: "6. Launch site filter: Global filter that applies to the summary cards, nationality launch card, payload mission card, and table". This answers some of my questions about how these numbers are calculated.
        - Assumption: The values displayed will be relative to all previous launches until the user adds a "launch site" filter, at which point the values displayed will be relative to all previous launches at that launch site only.
    - What should these cards do when hovered? When clicked? The chevron UI element indicates to me that they're meant to do something, but neither the written spec nor the Figma prototype answers this question.
        - Assumption: These cards shouldn't do anything special when clicked or hovered.
    - The background colors of these cards change when I hover over the "cog" button.
        - Assumption: This is a bug.
- ‚ùì Regarding the "Launch Site" "dropdown" at the top right of the page:
    - I'm guessing that this UI element is the way users switch between launch sites, which affects _all_ of the other data visible on the page. That's a very important UI element. What does it look like when a user clicks on that element? How does it behave? These questions are not answered by the prototype, so I'll have to make some assumptions on my own.
        - I believe that the "currently selected launch site" should be displayed somewhere on the page, besides just being the only site listed in the lower data table when a user has selected a launch site for filtering. I'll make use of that belief in my own design.
- ‚ùì Regarding the "Top 5 Missions" component:
    - What is the purpose of the "(?)" UI element? What should it show or do upon hover? Upon tap/click?
    - What is the scale of the black bar to the right of the "Payload Mass" numeric value?
        - Assumption: 0% === "0kg", 100% === "max payload mass for the top 5 missions shown"
            - This means that the top mission will always show a full "black bar."
- ‚ùì Regarding the "SpaceX Launch Data" table at the bottom of the page:
    - Is the data in the _mocked_ table meant to represent real, valid data?
        - Assumption: No, this mock is just for visual treatment. Reason for assumption: Two missions in the table with the same name, date, rocket, mass, site, and ID have different outcomes.

## Development Log
### 1. Read through the assignment fully, identifying key points and noting potential challenges or complications:
- ‚≠ê One-screen dashboard; not multiple screens
- ‚≠ê I have a starting point with respect to the technologies used and a project scaffold; I'm not starting from scratch.
    - I will stick with the general directory structure and technology configuration supplied to me, unless it's necessary for me to change any of those elements.
- ‚ùó I am familiar with React. I haven't personally used Next (I've used Express), Apollo GraphQL (manages local/remote data with GraphQL), or TailwindCSS (I've used plain CSS/Sass/`styled-components`)
    - I'm going to need to become familiar with the basics of these unfamiliar technologies early. That won't be a problem, but I won't learn expert-level syntax in time for this project. I know the basics will do just fine to accomplish my goals.
- ‚≠ê The design must be responsive to different screen sizes, but I won't be judged by the appearance of this dashboard on a mobile device.
- ‚ùó The GraphQL endpoint I'm using to populate the dashboard is not owned or controlled by Cylera, but rather SpaceX.
- ‚ùó I'm very familiar with Figma, but I don't know what Sympli is.
    - Upon creating a Sympli account and following the "design system link" below, it appears as though the Figma link offers a more detailed mockup versus the Sympli document. However, the Sympli document does allow me to download various assets the Cylera team integrated into the mockup, such as a "search" icon, "cog" icon, and "scale" icon. I'll download those assets now in vector format for use later.
        - Yikes, nevermind: the "vector" format supplied by Sympli is `.pdf`, which is unusable in this context, and I don't want to convert them. I'll use the `.png` assets provided by Sympli instead, but the `1x` versions of those assets won't scale nicely, and I'm not going to put the time in to figure out how to make use of the scaled bitmap assets in this app. If this were a real app, I'd talk to the designer, who could hopefully supply me with `.svg` assets.
        - Another problem with using `.png`s here is that the dark-to-light mode color transitions won't apply to these images, so they'll flicker in place as the dark/light mode transition occurs. Doesn't look great, but I'm not going to worry about that now.
        - I'm going to use Tailwind's `@heroicons` package for some of the iconography that I can't easily extract from the design documents.
            - **_Hang on a second!_** The iconography used in these design documents _is_ from Heroicons by TailwindCSS! OK - I'm going back now and replacing all of the `.png` icons I used with the SVGs from Heroicons. That's a big win! This also solves the above problem of the icons flickering.
- ‚≠ê Cylera provided me with both a near-pixel-perfect design document _and_ textual descriptions of the various components contained within that document. Nice. As I'm developing, I'll be able to reference both documents to build each component to spec, making sure to note questions and assumptions about each component.
- ‚ùóI wish I had access to the full Figma document rather than just the prototype. If I had access to the document, I'd better be able to determine things like typefaces used, font sizes, exact colors, etc. I'll do my best.
    - Using [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont), I determined that the typeface used throughout the mockup is probably Proxima Nova - which isn't free. I'll use Metropolis, a free close alternative.
    - Using PowerToys' color picker, I determined the various colors used throughout the mockup and integrated those hex colors into Tailwind's theme.
- ‚ùó I'm "not expected to finish every component." I should be mindful about which components will give me the biggest wins, and which components will be easy to knock out if I make the right architectural decisions early.
    - "Dark mode" comes to mind as an example of a feature that will be easy to knock out if I architect this application correctly. In my cursory look at Tailwind's documentation, it appears as though dark mode is _very_ straightforward to implement, if I correctly use Tailwind's features.
- ‚ùó I don't know how to use any of the "Hints" yet, upon first read. Perhaps those will come in handy later.
### 2. Run the project as-is, just to make sure the project works as provided to me directly by Cylera.
- The project instructions don't tell me which version of NodeJS I should have installed, nor do they tell me to run `npm i` first to install project dependencies. I will make sure to include those details in my "How to Run This Project" section before submission.
- The project as-is does not give me much by way of a starting point. None of the existing code is documented, nor is its purpose clear as it pertains to the project. How am I supposed to use what's here, if at all?
    - What is the purpose of `/styles/Home.module.css`?
### 3. Begin with the page header: the main page wrapper, the header, the page title, the "settings" button, and the "launch site" dropdown. Write this initial code with the goal of making it _easy_ to implement the dark theme later.
- There's a Tailwind Labs project called "Headless UI": "Completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components,  designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS." Sounds like exactly what I need for UI elements like the dropdown menu, toggle switch, etc. I'm going to use it.
- I'm changing the label for the dark mode toggle from "Light / Dark Theme" to "Dark Mode", since the job of the switch is to inform the user whether the state associated with the label is "on" or "off". Using a "Light / Dark Theme" label doesn't inform the user what will happen when the state of the switch is on _or_ off. 
- I made some slight changes to the cog dropdown transition; I think it looks/feels better than the mockup. Subjective!
- I'm going to use Popper JS (as recommended by Tailwind) for reliable placement of the cog dropdown menu so I don't have to figure that out myself.
- I had to recolor the white `cog.png` icon exported from Sympli to `#0981c3` for one of the states of the cog button.
- I had to make the following change to `tailwind.config.js` to use separate dark- and light-mode background images for the cog icon:
    ```
    variants: {
        extend: { backgroundImage: ['dark'] },
    },
    ```
- I had to add some strange wrappers and logic to the Listbox component in order to avoid animation jank. It's nice and smooth now, though!
- I took some design liberties with the launch site filter dropdown, since there wasn't much by way of direction there in the mockups.
- Using the https://api.spacex.land/graphql/ GraphQL API for the launch site filter dropdown was fairly straightforward. Figuring out how to get all possible launch sites was a well-bounded problem, and, despite the lack of documentation for the API, I was able to figure that out.
### 4. After finishing the header, it's time to move on to the three summary cards, which rely on the selected launch site from the end of (3).
- I can't find _any_ documentation for this unofficial SpaceX API, so I have to rely on assumptions for what the data keys mean. For example...
    - What's are the actual definitions of the terms "mission" and "launch"?
    - _Why_ do only some launches have `mission_id` data?
    - What are the differences between `launchLatest`, `launchNext`, `launches`, `launchesPast`, `launchesPastResult`, and `launchesUpcoming`?
- I might be able to answer some of my own questions by spending time running experimental queries. However, I don't want to put that much time into understanding this. Thus, I'm just going to make _some decisions_ about the way I use this data, even if it doesn't exactly accomplish the goals intended by the designer or manager in charge of this interview "project."
- Here's how I'm going to use the data:
    1. I'll get a list of all Launches, and the Mission ID(s) associated with those launches.
        - If the user has selected a Launch Site other than "All Launch Sites" from the Dashboard, the GraphQL query used to obtain this list will include a `find: {site_id: "<selected site ID>"}` filter.
    2. I'll also get a list of all Missions and their IDs, as well as the payload IDs associated with each of those Missions.
        - When I try to query for `missions.payloads.customers` - no matter the rest of the query - I get a `query exceeds complexity limit` error when running the query. Thus, I have to do some more cross-referencing...see (3) below.
    3. I'll also get a list of all Payloads, their IDs, their customers, and their masses (in kilograms).
    4. This query will return all of the data that I need for the three Summary Cards in the Dashboard. I'll filter and mutate the returned data so it can give me what I need to display. You can learn more about the way I massaged that data in [`components/SummaryCards.tsx`](components/SummaryCards.tsx).
- I'm removing the right chevron from each summary card and making them not clickable or hoverable, since I'm not sure what the intended behavior is when the user clicks on one of those cards.
- Changed "Total Payload Customers" label to "Unique Customers", under the assumption that this label is more accurate to the intent of the displayed dashboard data.
- I came really close to showing an animated loading indicator on the cards while data was loading, but decided not to for times' sake. The temptation is present!
    - Okay, the next day I came back and added a loading spinner. It's just too important.
        - At the same time, I also updated TailwindCSS and its upstream dependencies to `tailwind@latest`.
- To me, the most interesting summary cards display when the Launch Site filter is set to "Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4E". If my filtering logic is correct... one mission, 8 payloads, average payload mass of 8,938 kg. Woah!
### 5. Next: The "Payload Count by Nationality" component.
- Thankfully, I'm going to be able to use a lot of what I learned from implementing the summary cards here.
- A general note: It would be faster for me to query the GraphQL endpoint on an app level without any sort of `find:` filter, and then pass the data down to each component, at which point each component could filter the data. However, I want to ensure that each of these Components is self-contained, and I want to show off that I can do GraphQL queries with variables. üòÑ
- I started off using a simple dictionary to store the data necessary to create this Component's UI. The dictionary's key is the "Nationality" of the payload, and the value associated with that key is the number of payloads associated for that nationality. This data structure isn't very extensible, but that's OK. Simplicity here is king, while the requirements for the component are very well-defined.
    - Later, after choosing to use `react-minimal-pie-chart`, I decided to go with a slightly more complicated data structure to make compatibility with the pie chart library simple.
- Are the pie chart and data table supposed to show _all_ of the relevant nationalities, or just the top 5? The latter doesn't make much sense from a data visualization perspective (it is _likelier_ that "X percentage of all" "X percentage of top 5"), so I'm going to assume the pie chart and data table should show all of the filtered nationalities.
- I started writing my own pie chart library, but decided that would take too much time. Instead, I'll use [`react-minimal-pie-chart`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-minimal-pie-chart).
- I created a utility function to return a stable hex color given a string. This lets me associate each unique nationality with a unique color.
- The "Nationality" and "Payload Count" headers in the mockup are a different typeface from the rest. I'm not going to use a different typeface for my submission (not worth the extra time).
- I'm using `react-tooltip` to make tooltip integration easier. Don't want to write my own library for that, either.
- The cursor targets for the pie chart as designed are too small for my liking, so that's something I'd like to talk to the designer about.
- The margin between the table header and the table body in the mockup is larger than what I implemented. I don't want to spend too much time trying to re-style `<table>` elements.
### 6. Onto the "Top 5 Missions" component.
- Same as the last component - I'm going to be able to use much of what I learned from implementing the previous component here.
- I'm finding myself having to come up with untenable names for colors because there are so many different colors in this design. I would talk to the designer about the color palette used in the app to minimize the number of colors used, or come up with better names for the colors.
- I chose to align the items in the flex container holding the "payload count" and "top 5 missions" components to `items-stretch`. This can create some space inside the shorter card between the two, if one is shorter than the other. I believe this design to be preferable to there being extra whitepace below the shorter card.
- I am quite proud of this data table. üòÄ
- Regarding the black scale bars, to reiterate a design assumption from above:
    - 0% === "0kg", 100% === "max payload mass for the top 5 missions shown"
        - This means that the top mission will always show a full "black bar."
    - I know for sure that this wasn't the designer's intention - else the top bar in the mock's data table would be full - so I'd want to talk to the designer about this. However, I think my design does a good job of showing relative payload masses for those top five displayed missions.
- That was the fastest component I've built so far! I couldn't have done this so quickly without the proper architecture I developed in the previous components.
### 7. Finally, the data table component!
- I'm going to start off by doing client-side sorting and filtering and without pagination, then I'll migrate to server-side filtering with pagination. This way, it'll be easiest for me to develop the component UI _first_, then I can take care of the rest of the component requirements.
- Wow - building this component requires the simplest GraphQL query so far! I can get all of the data I need by querying `launches`. Thank goodness - parsing the returned data and modifying it to fit my needs was one of the biggest pains when developing the previous components.
    - Edit, from many hours later: I just realized that the "payload mass" for each launch when querying this way is exactly the same: 35120 kilograms. I'm not going to spend the time to get the proper masses here.
- I'm formatting the dates in the table as dates/times relative to the user's time settings, as I think that is most readable and makes the most sense in this context.
- I noticed that I was spending too long on the table fullscreen animation, so I stopped working on it. There are several improvements I could make to it, but making accordion-like animations with containers of variable height is a challenge, and I'd need to spend more time than I want to right now on getting that perfect. It's _fine_ now.
- I spent a _long_ time on the "fullscreen table" UI. The current implementation is _fine_ - same as the fullscreen table animation, as noted above - but it relies on some CSS tricks I don't fully understand. (I think that's how CSS works for most people, right?) For example, in order to get the `<table>` to properly constrain to a parent, I had to set one of the parent container's heights to `0`. Why? I don't know. I'm not going to touch it, and I'm going to move on for now. It's fine. It's something I'd want to better understand if this were production code.

## Improvements I'd Make
- Sometimes, when I make requests to the GraphQL endpoint too quickly, I get rate-limited. That's a problem to be solved.
- It can be jarring for users when client-side containers change size as their contents change size. Having

# The Assignment
The goal of this project is to build a one-screen dashboard consisting of a few components. We've created a design for this dashboard, and your job is to implement it. This repo is a starting point, with some of the scaffolding in place to get you started. You're expected to use the following technologies in your solution:
- React
- Next
- Apollo GraphQL
- TailwindCSS

In addition, your solution won't be viewed on a mobile device but it does need to be responsive. 

## Dataset
You'll use a publicly available GraphQL endpoint with data from SpaceX launches, found here: https://api.spacex.land/graphql/. 

## The Design
Figma link: https://www.figma.com/proto/4YRep3EnjvbRhlgJnZ4fMl/Tailwind-Figma-UI?node-id=2633%3A44067&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=2632%3A42983&starting-point-node-id=2633%3A44067

Design system link: https://app.sympli.io/p/b7af245c13a878803bead2bfc9b2fcf7e4d75002b9:61eecfbd516143575ba7a12b

## Components & Features
1. Summary statistic cards
    - 3 cards arrayed across the top of the page, showing the total payload, average payload, and number of customers
2. Table of launches
    - Paginated table of launch data
    - Page size is constant
    - Columns: mission name, launch date, launch success (outcome), rocket name, payload mass, site name, mission ID
3. Launches by nationality
    - Pie chart by nationality
    - Legend with count for each country
4. Top missions by payload mass
    - 5 missions with the greatest total payload mass
5. Server-side filtering and sorting for table
    - All columns should be sortable, with an indicator of sorting direction (if a sort is applied)
    - Search bar that filters results based on mission name
    - Filtering and sorting should happen server side
6. Launch site filter
    - Global filter that applies to the summary cards, nationality launch card, payload mission card, and table
7. Animations
    - Table is expandable to be full screen. Animation is demonstrated in prototype at Figma link.
8. Dark mode
    - Global setting can toggle UI theme from light mode to dark mode. Colors and animation are demonstrated in prototype at Figma link.

Note: you aren't expected to finish every component. Like with real assignments, you may have to make tradeoffs and compromises to deliver a product on time. You should be prepared to discuss the decisions that were made throughout the development process.

## Hints
- Launches and missions have a many-to-many relationship.
- The mission name for a launch may contain multiple mission names joined by slashes.
- Not all launches have mission IDs to cross-reference to the missions dataset; the mission filter does not need to provide an option representing these.
- You can cross reference payloads with launch sites via missions.

## Deadline & Submission
You have a week to complete this assignment. It shouldn't take that long, but we're giving you enough time to get familiar with the project. To begin your work, you should fork this repo. When you're ready to submit, share the repo with us and provide instructions to run your assignment.

## Scoring Rubric
We'll be assessing the final product on a number of criteria, primarily focusing on: the accuracy of the UI compared to the design, the functionality of the interactive components, the code quality, and the performance of the GraphQL queries.

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
